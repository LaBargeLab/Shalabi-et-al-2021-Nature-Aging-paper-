This resource provides the R code to reproduce key results described in our paper; link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00104-9. 

The analysis here is divided into Five main files:
- The first describes the code required to generate the waterfall plor for the immunoflorescent image analysis in Figure 1. 
- The second describes the code needed for the cKit differntiation analysis in Figure 3. 
- The last three files describe the code used for the RNA seq analysis in Figure 4 and Figure 5 and they are divided as follows: 
    - The first describes the differential gene expression analysis
    - The second describes the gene set enrichment analysis described in the paper
    - The third describes the gene list overlap analysis
